# hunt-the-wumpus-2d

A (not a very good) 2D implementation of the hunt the wumpus using mono game.

It's been a while since I wrote this, and this was my first time doing any event
based programming. I just remember it being buggy and don't recall if it was
fully implemented.

## setup

insure you have latest .NET: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48130

install monogame:

Monogame Extended is also used, but I think it will just work.

If you encouter problems with building please try to reference the pipeline: http://www.dylanwilson.net/how-to-install-monogame-extended
